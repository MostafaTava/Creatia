# 🌐 Creatia

**Creatia** is a personal and team-based creative hub built to showcase my work and manage projects across **web development**, **graphic design**, **video editing**, and **coding**.  
It functions both as my **portfolio website** and as a **project management platform** for coordinating tasks and passing jobs to my teammates.

## 🚀 Purpose

Creatia is designed with two main goals:

1. **Showcase My Work**  
   A place to present professional projects including:
   - Web development (front-end & back-end)
   - Graphic design and branding
   - Video editing and motion graphics
   - Custom coding and automation tools  

2. **Manage Team Projects**  
   As a group leader, I use Creatia to organize, assign, and track ongoing projects.  
   It helps maintain efficiency, consistency, and collaboration across all team members.
